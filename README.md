Simulation of the temperature rise given by a metallic heater on a system of thin films multilayer using a matrix formalism. The thermal response is given for a range of frequency which is determined by the electrical current excitation source. We consider a heater placed at the top of the system and a semi-infinite boundary condition on the substrate.
